## 📖 How to use

  - Or to run locally, pull the repository and run ```npm run dev```
  - **Guide** If you don't know your API key:
    - **Register / Login** [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)
      - Setup your **billing** [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview), don't forget to set a **billing limit** as well [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits). And then generate an **API key** [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). You should be able to find  everything in the top right corner "**Manage Account**" page.
      - Once you have your API key just go to **Settings** on my app in the bottom left corner and from there you should see it right away.


🚀 My ChatGPT offers a range of features. In addition to a sexy purple theme, it includes the option to utilize your own OpenAI API key, handled on the client side via a controlled endpoint making the user experience amazing-- I hope. Basically use chatGPT but it's nicer. A usage calculator is included to help you track your expenses by calculating token count with OpenAI's Tokenizer. While the calculator may not be 100% accurate, it is still pretty good!

Furthermore, you get the ability to send messages without history, which is useful when you need to ask a sequence of unrelated questions. It also has a summarization feature for chats that exceed the 4k token limit while retaining context.\
